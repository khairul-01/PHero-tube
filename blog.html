               The scope of var, let, and const
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p>Var: Var is old variable type. It was introduced before ES6. It is global variable. If any variable declare with var, it can be access from any block. We can reassign value even redeclare same variable name with var.Var is hoisted with undefined value. So, var is not secure now-a-days. Because, it's value can be modify from anywhere. So, we should not use var.

               let: Let is block scop. If we declare a variable with let in global scope, then we can access this variable from block scop. But, if we declare a variable with let in block scope we can't access this variable outside the block scope. We can reassign a value to let variable. But, we can't redeclare a variable with same name. let is hoisted but it is not assigned with value. so, it show error without assigning value.

               const: const is same as let variable. We can't access block variable outside the block. const variable have declare with assigning value. Otherwise it will give error. We can't reassign or update const varible's value. It is also hoisted like let variable.

               The use cases of null and undefined
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p>null: null is primitive value. Null in JavaScript means empty value. When we need to assign empty value to any variable, we assign it with null as null contain no value. With typeof we check this type.

               undefined: undefined is also primitive value. but undefined in JavaScript means a variable is declared but it value has not been assigned. With typeof we check this type.
